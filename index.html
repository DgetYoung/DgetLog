There are few and incomplete descriptions of the rules of <b>Vietnamese mahjong</b> available in English on the web, so here I've sought to compile all the information I've been able to gather on the subject.<br>
<br>
The <b>Classical</b> Vietnamese mahjong tileset consists of the 144 tiles of Chinese sets plus eight additional special flower tiles called fairies, kings and queens, or emperors and empresses, and eight specialized joker or "frame" tiles.<br>
<br>
In addition to these, <b>Modern</b> Vietnamese tilesets include at least two more copies of each of the eight jokers, and possibly more, for a total of 176-190 tiles.<br>
<br>
Classical sets seem by far the easier to acquire, at least in the US. I got my set, from Mose Cafolo, through Amazon. It seems the so-called "modern" sets may have enjoyed only a brief period of popularity (somewhere around the 1980s and 90s) before the pendulum swung hard the other way. According to BGG user @circiter, classical Vietnamese sets are the most commonly sold in Vietnam today, but players often only actually use the 144 tiles of Chinese sets, or even fewer, due to the rising popularity of variants like Riichi and Sichuan Bloody Mahjong.
